## About the project

### Purpose

- GamePlan is an interactive website that lets friends coordinate with each other to hunt in a calendar format.
- I wanted to create my own website my friends and I could use, improve my software development skills, create a project that utilizes full stack development, and push myself to learn new ways to code.

### Key Features

- Shows scheduled or planned dates between friends
- Shows what species is in season on what dates
- Shows regulation for species by state
- Gives information about species you want to hunt (ex: images, calls, behavior, etc)
- Integrates with users google calendar

## Built With
