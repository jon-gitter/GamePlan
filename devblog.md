# Project Development Blog

## Purpose

- The purpose of this file is to document the process, lessons learned, and concepts explored while creating GamePlan. I want a reference for the future to go over difficult concepts I tackled so I either won't forget or show my growth over time.

## Blog

- 5/26/2022: Took me a while to get back in the loop of HTML outline and CSS basics. Good refresh. Easier to use a template to model then trying to do everything from inside your mind. Completed some basic custom logos for the page. Completed the header but still need to add style. Transition and colors were easy to do on the page. I added another feature I want to see, a background that changes on scroll. Still need to make nav bar at top sticky for user.

- 5/27/2022: Fixed an annoying problem I had that was keeping my button from smooth scrolling, solution was I had a class id in my javascript (.) instead of the (#) for the button id that I created. As soon as I made this tiny fix the button worked.
